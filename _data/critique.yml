  Generation Z (Gen Z) is the group of people who were born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s. They are the first generation to have grown up with lifelong access to the Internet and portable digital technology. Therefore, they are expected to love technology and are inclined to take technology as their career path. The author of this article, however, brings up a contradictory conclusion that Gen Z’s members are not the “tech” generation because many young people are simply uninterested in IT jobs. He drew the conclusion based on a piece of data in the CompTIA report: “A mere 13% of 13-17 year-olds surveyed said they want to pursue a career in IT.” 

  First of all, the author grabs survey numbers without doing the math. The Gen Z population in the US is 67 million. 13% of that is 8.7 million. Do we need so many people to work in IT? According to the data provided in the article, there are 34.05 million IT support requests every three months, which means 340 thousand IT requests per day on average. Most IT support job responsibilities are walking clients through steps to help them resolve their technical problems, such as Installing/configuring software and troubleshooting/resolving issues with software or hardware. Since day-to-day IT support requests are not hard to resolve, if we assume that one IT support person can resolve 5 issues a day, the current job market only needs 68 (340/5) thousand IT support specialists. That indicates that only 0.8% of 8.7 million who are interested in IT would have an opportunity to get an IT job! 

  What about the vast majority of other kids interested in IT who could not get an IT job? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be 511,800 jobs for Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services professionals, so some of the IT lovers could obtain computer science jobs instead. However, the total number of computer science jobs is only 6% of the 8.7 million of Gen Zers who are interested in IT. College students in computer science do indeed need strong math and sciences skills, which calls into question the author’s viewpoint in the article. Computer science is a highly selective major. Not everyone who wishes to specialize in computer science could be admitted to a college computer science program, but many more could do tech jobs and majors.

  Obviously, the author mixes up the concept of technology in general (tech) with Information Technology (IT), so he incorrectly posits that kids who are uninterested in IT jobs must also be uninterested in technology. Actually, technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, so it is much broader than IT, which is only a small branch of computer science. A tech person could be anybody in the STEM field. This article does show CompTIA’s survey data that 70% of Gen Zs love technology, but failed to use this piece of data to draw the right conclusion that Gen Z is indeed a “tech” generation.
