                    I have been deeply involved in software design, robotics,
                    and CyberSecurity since high school. Five years of robotics
                    and three years of CyberPatriot competitions lead me to
                    national level awards in both areas. I have continued my
                    focus in computer science while in college, as I took
                    classes in and out of school, did a number of software
                    development projects, and worked as research assistant at
                    UCSD, and an intern at FurtureWei and a startup company,
                    Genvira Biosciences, Inc. Over time, my software studies,
                    competitions, and internship have helped me create my career
                    vision to become a software, robotics, or cybersecurity
                    specialist for a business.
