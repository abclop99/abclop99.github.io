                    <p>I have been deeply involved in software design, robotics, and CyberSecurity since high school. Five years of robotics
                    and three years of CyberPatriot competitions lead me to national level awards in both areas. I have continued my focus
                    in computer science while in college, as I took classes in and out of school, did a number of software development
                    projects, and worked as an intern at a startup company, Genvira Biosciences, Inc., where I built their website, set-up
                    its IT infrastructure, and developed machine-learning software from a biological database. Over time, my software
                    studies, competitions, and internship have helped me create my career vision to become a software, robotics, and
                    cybersecurity specialist for a business.</p>
