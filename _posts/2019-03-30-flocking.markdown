description: |
    A simulation of flocking behavior in [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). Boids have three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

    This program simulates flocking behavior in birds, fish, etc. Boids' flocking behavior is emergent from a few simple rules:
    - Separation: Each boid moves away from nearby boids.
    - Alignment: Each boid attempts to match the speed and direction of the boids surrounding it.
    - Cohesion: Each boid attempts to go toward the center of mass of the nearby boids.

    The program implements the three rules and attempts to make the boids try to avoid obstacles (poorly).

    The program was originally written in Java then converted to Kotlin, and uses the Processing library for graphics.
