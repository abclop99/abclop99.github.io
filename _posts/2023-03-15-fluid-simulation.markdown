description: |
    This is a simple smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) based fluid
    simulation with computation running on the GPU.

    - Written in Rust
    - WGPU for graphics pipeline
    - WGSL for writing shaders
    - egui for GUI to adjust values

    - Uses the simplest version of SPH from a paper 
    - Has some stability issues
