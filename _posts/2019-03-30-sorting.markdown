description: |
    Compares different sorting algorithms by sorting scrambled colors in parallel. It shows how fast each algorithm is compared to others. The program implements a variety of sorting algorithms including
    - Bubble Sort
    - Cocktail Shaker Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Radix Sort

    Running the program with a large height (number of values to sort) shows a clear difference between algorithms that are \\(O(n^2)\\) and algorithms are \\(O(n\log n)\\) and shows smaller differences such as between using different methods to create a heap in HeapSort.

    This program was inspired by many videos/GIFs of sorting algorithms.
